== Description ==

*Safer Login* is a light plugin enables webmaster and administrators that allows to change wp-admin url to any custom url they want easily as well as safely. Nothing would be changed in wordpress core. The plugin simple intercepts page requests on your WordPress website. Using this plugin is kind of like you have a safebox with hidden lock, thieves and hackers can`t find the lock and can`t figure out where they should start to unlocking your safebox! as smart as that. Please bookmark your new admin url or use an address which is specific to you and make sure that you can memorize it easily because acticating the old wp-admin directory and wp-login.php page will become unavailable. You can bring wp-admin url to the regular simply by disabling the plugin and your website will work just as the same it was before.
